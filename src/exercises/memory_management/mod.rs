//! # Memory Management Exercises
//!
//! ## Learning Objectives
//! - Understand Rust's ownership system
//! - Master borrowing and references
//! - Work with lifetimes effectively
//! - Implement Drop trait and RAII patterns
//! - Ensure memory safety without garbage collection
//! - Learn zero-cost abstractions
//!
//! ## Topics Covered
//! - Ownership transfer and move semantics
//! - Borrowing (mutable and immutable)
//! - Lifetime annotations
//! - References and dereferencing
//! - Drop trait and resource management
//! - RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
//! - Memory safety guarantees
//! - Zero-cost abstractions
//!
//! ## Difficulty Distribution (30 exercises)
//! - Easy: 8 exercises (01-08) - Ownership basics, borrowing
//! - Medium: 12 exercises (09-20) - Lifetimes, references, collections
//! - Hard: 8 exercises (21-28) - Complex lifetimes, custom Drop, RAII
//! - Expert: 2 exercises (29-30) - Advanced lifetime bounds, zero-cost abstractions
